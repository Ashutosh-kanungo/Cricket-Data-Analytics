# Cricket Data analyst poject

this is an end to end project build on the data of the icc cricket world cup 2019, we chose top players from each category such as 
opners, bowlers , all rounders etc and there statistics were analysed to chose the best.
 


## Workflow

1. First data was scraped from the ESPN cricketinfo site using a   online web scraper which directly gave us the required data in various excel sheets.
2. Now the data that we managed to scrap was present in different sheets and and many misordered collumns and followed by null values so the Preprocessing and cleaning part was performed by using Pandas frame work in Jupyter notebook.
3. Data tranformation was performed using power query.
4. Relation was set btw different sheets .
5. Data modeling and various Measures were build using DAX.
6. Dashboard was prepared  in power bi.
7. Insights were collected.
